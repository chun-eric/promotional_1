<h1>Sleek Furniture</h1>

<h3>About the Project</h3>
<p>
A promotional email I designed and coded for a fictional upmarket modern furniture company called Sleek Furniture. The goal of this promotional email is to help boost sales for the company for its Black Friday sale. The email is responsive and works on all email clients. I used HTML, CSS, and Photoshop to create the email and Email on Acid to test it on different email clients.
